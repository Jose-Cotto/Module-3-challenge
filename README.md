# Module 3 Password generator challenge

## Description

This password generator was created to provide a randomized password based on a few user decisions. This project polished my skills with Javascript functions as well as variables, arrays , conditional statements and for loops. I learned the importance of the order of syntax and creating a list of Todo's so the order of operation is clear. This challenge also inadvertently stressed the importance of trouble shooting whether it be with console.logs or vs code extensions.
